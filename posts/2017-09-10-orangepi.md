# Getting up and running with Orange Pi

I bought my Orange Pi Zero cheaply from [AliExpress][aliexpress-opi]
for a little over Â£10, shipping included. It comes neatly packaged and
a small plastic case is provided.

I downloaded an [Armbian image][armbian] and burned it to my SD card:

    pv Armbian_5.30_Orangepizero_Ubuntu_xenial_default_3.4.113.img | dd of=/dev/disk2 bs=64m

The card then goes into the card slot on the board.

To [connect to the board][wiring-uart] through serial interface I used
my [CP2102-based USB-UART bridge][cp2102-usb-uart]. On macOS extra
[drivers from Silicon Labs][cp2102-macos-drivers] are needed, while
Linux already includes `cp2102` module. I guess any other USB-UART
bridge will work equally well (PL2302, FT232).

Note that the pin marked TX on the board must be connected to RX pin
on the bridge, and vice versa. The board must be powered before use
(there're a lot of warnings on Armbian website about the importance of
a proper power supply, although I got basic stuff working only using
my laptop USB port as a power source for the board).

I used minicom as a terminal with the following settings
(`minirc.dfl`): hardware flow control is switched off and port is set
according to the device created by my CP2102:

```
# Machine-generated file - use "minicom -s" to change parameters.
pu port             /dev/tty.SLAB_USBtoUART
pu lock             /usr/local/Cellar/minicom/2.7/var
pu escape-key       Escape (Meta)
pu rtscts           No
```

Start `minicom`, plug the serial interface and a standard Linux login
prompt will be seen in the terminal.

The default `root` password is `1234` which will need to be changed on
the first login.

To connect to a wireless network:

    nmcli dev wifi connect <NAME> password <PASSWORD>

It appears that after being configured once, the connection will be
established automatically [by default][autoconnect-prop].

With the node online I could just SSH in and start doing my serious
Orange Pi business.

# How to use NodeMCU with ESP-01

[ESP-01][] modules from Ai-Thinker seem to be the cheapest option when
it comes to microcontrollers with Wi-Fi connectivity.

Any USB-UART bridge like [CP2102][] can be used to connect ESP-01 to a
computer USB port for programming. On macOS extra [drivers from
Silicon Labs][cp2102-macos-drivers] will be needed.

[UART breakout][uart-breakout] boards for ESP-01 are very handy when
attaching the board to the UART bridge header via a [4-pin
cable][4pin]. As usual, TX pin on the bridge should connect to RX pin
on the board, and vice versa.

## AT commands test

[AT commands][esp8266-at] may be used out of the box with a newly
bought ESP-01 module. If using `minicom` serial terminal, one should
«send» commands to the module with `C-j` (a simple Enter key won't
work).

## Flash NodeMCU

To build [NodeMCU firmware][fw], I used [marcelstoer/nodemcu-build][]
Docker image that contains the toolchain. This left me with a
`nodemcu_float_master_*.bin` file that needs to get onto the board.
Time to flash NodeMCU and get hacking! I used [esptool][] and
[nodemcu-uploader][]:

    pip install esptool nodemcu-uploader

GPIO0 pin *must* be pulled down prior to powering the board to enter
the flashing mode (I used a pin to short GND and GPIO0). Now the
command to run is:

    esptool.py --port /dev/tty.SLAB_USBtoUART write_flash -fm qio 0x00000 bin/nodemcu_float_master_20180210-1805.bin

This has to be done only once (unless you change the firmware and/or
its config).

## Use Lua to program ESP-01

Now `*.lua` files for your project using [NodeMCU][] can be uploaded
to the board via

    nodemcu-uploader --port /dev/tty.SLAB_USBtoUART upload *.lua

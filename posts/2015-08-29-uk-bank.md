# How to open a UK bank account when you just arrived in the country

A common problem for new arrivals in the UK is opening a bank account.
Most of banks require a proof of address which you may not be able to
provide if you just flew in and are living in a temporary
accomodation. Renting an apartment with a real estate agency will also
likely require a bank account, which means there's a circular
dependency between renting and having an account. Any expat forum is
full of cries for help from people desperate to establish financial
foothold in the UK. Best course of action when dealing with this sort
of thing is not panicking and trying to experience the ordeal as an
RPG quest. I've been in this Catch-22 situation myself and tried
several banks with varying degrees of success. The experience
described was in London in August 2015 and certainly some rules may
change in the future.

## Bootstrapping kit

The only documents I had on the day of my arrival were:

- passport with a valid T2G visa

- [police registration certificate][prc]

PRC is issued on the spot at [OVRO][ovro] and states your address that
you report, with a big police stamp over it.

I rented a room for the first two weeks and I could receive paper
correspondence there. As I found out later, banks may accept [NIN
allocation letter from HMRC][nin-hmrc] as a proof of address, with
examples being [Metro][metro-poa] and [Natwest][natwest-poa].
Therefore requesting one as soon as possible is a good idea (it will
still take some time for the application to be processed and NIN
confirmation letter to arrive).

I also read that a letter from the employer helps. I asked for one as
soon as I started. It came with a company letterhead and stated my
start date, job title, salary and my current UK address (the wording
was something like «The current address we have on file for Dmitry
is…»). This letter was how I eventually got my bank account with HSBC.
My first bank visits were less successfull though.

## Lloyds

For some reason Lloyds is often recommended as a starter bank for
those new to the UK. I still don't know why, their
[requirements][lloyds-poa] are no different from any other bank.

Borough branch experience was brief:

— Hi, can I open an account?\
— Do you have a appointment? *(I could see the lady giving me a weird look)*\
— No\
— Please use our website to make one

And of course the website declines online applications that don't
include 3 years of UK address history!

I had more success at Lloyds Wimbledon branch. After examining my PRC
the clerk made several calls and booked an appointment *two weeks
later*. They agreed to accept my PRC as a proof of address after
requesting «a special permission» from someone up the chain of
command.

## HSBC

I managed to book my appointment by phone, explaining the situation.
This was after a week I've been in the UK and I already had a letter
from the employer. I brought it to Wimbledon branch of HSBC. The clerk
was seemingly impressed and even shared his thoughts on Mail's
editorial policy, complaining about not enough of sports events
coverage. They even offered a credit card. The account was opened,
cards and PIN codes arrived to my temporary address next week, along
with a security token. Yay! I was relieved.

A week later I got to the appointment at Lloyds as well, equipped with
my PRC, which also allowed me to open an account.

## Natwest

Clerks at Kensington branch of Natwest were puzzled both by my PRC and
my letter from the employer:

— Hmm, do you work in the police?\
— No!

His logic was flawless, but it didn't help me to open an account.

## Metro

Unlike with any other bank, at «[hassle-free][metro-poa]» Metro bank I
was asked not one, but TWO proofs of address, and I had none. No free
lollipop could cheer me up. I walked out sadly.

# Communication skills

Communication Skills workshop from [AGL][] was interesting. Even
developing some basic awareness of how you come across does make a
difference.

Some points to remember:

- Keep a good posture (imagine a line between your head and the
  ceiling), breathe to keep a good pace.

- More empathy! Use simple examples or shared experience to resonate
  with the audience.

- Building up tension makes your speech more involving.

- Asking a question helps tailor the message to the audience.

- Finish the talk with a call to action.

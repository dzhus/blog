# How to use NodeMCU with ESP-01

When using a newly bought [ESP-01][] module from Ai-Thinker with `minicom`
serial terminal, one should «send» commands to the module with `C-j`
(a simple Enter key won't work). [AT commands][esp8266-at] may be used
out of the box.

To build [NodeMCU firmware][fw], I used [marcelstoer/nodemcu-build][]
Docker image that contains the toolchain. This left me with a
`nodemcu_float_master_*.bin` file that needs to get onto the board.
Time to flash NodeMCU and get hacking! I used [esptool][] and
[nodemcu-uploader][]:

    pip inistall esptool nodemcu-uploader

GPIO0 pin has to be pulled down prior to powering the board to enter
the flashing mode (I used a pin to short GND and GPIO0). Now the
command to run is:

    esptool.py --port /dev/tty.SLAB_USBtoUART write_flash -fm qio 0x00000 bin/nodemcu_float_master_20180210-1805.bin

This has to be done only once (unless you change the firmware and/or
its config).

From now on, project `*.lua` files can be uploaded to the board via

    nodemcu-uploader --port /dev/tty.SLAB_USBtoUART upload *.lua

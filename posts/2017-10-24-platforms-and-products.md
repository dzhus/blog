# Platforms and products

Reading [Steve Yegge's rant about Google][sy-google] not being a
platform reminded me of something I originally learned after getting
familiar with financial services companies: market-makers are more
successful than speculators in the long run.

The same works for software development (and perhaps everything else):
successful companies build their business around providing a platform,
not a specific product. Making everything a platform encourages good
design and a lot of good practises. Becoming a platform also helps you
offset potential risks associated with building products by letting
others take those risks. This is similar to how living off agent fees
and market friction looks more attractive than having to risk making a
wrong market decision. It's a little uncool, but safer.
